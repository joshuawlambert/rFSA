Description: Assists in statistical model building to find optimal and semi-optimal higher order interactions
    and best subsets. Uses the lm(), glm(), and other R functions to fit models generated from a feasible 
    solution algorithm. Discussed in Subset Selection in Regression, A Miller (2002). Applied and explained
    for least median of squares in Hawkins (1993) <doi:10.1016/0167-9473(93)90246-P>. The feasible solution 
    algorithm comes up with model forms of a specific type that can have fixed variables, higher order 
    interactions and their lower order terms.
